> :man_technologist:  In a nut(zsh)shell, some Software Engineer, who develops, deploys and open sources around with variable amounts of javascript, python, bash & irony 😉

Hello there :wave:
====================
<p align="center">🟨 🟥 🟦</p>

Hey, I'm ***Adrien***, a french versatile software engineer living in Paris. :slightly_smiling_face:
<!-- MAYBE add phonetic/pronciation, and mention adrian variant or adriean combo -->

Programmatically speaking, I craft code but also do some data, devops, tooling, doc&diagrams plus some open source. My main languages are javascript, python, and some shell, zsh flavor, and consider that git *c'est la vie* :light_blue_heart:

As of personality, in two words, I'm an hybrid movie gomer, late show watcher, punchline enthusiast, standup comedian enjoyer, comics reader, craft amator, green thumb , photograph on the fly ... and obviously some gourmand food and drink lover :blue_heart:
(having some kind of random memory, it's possible there was some approximation, oversight or leftover  :innocent:)

<!-- TODO add contact here, maybe hidden formula from there -->

<!-- TODO: add some custom emoji/gif (diabolo,hello there, roll safe, coyote wink) -->

Aside for being some kind of **expert in procrastination** and **heavy emoji user**, I have some personal project like [diractions](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/diractions) or [zsh-quiet-accept-line](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/zsh-quiet-accept-line) and did some significative contributions to tools I use: :toolbox:

If ever you dig on my [repos](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe?tab=repositories) you might also find some CLIs (like [bundle-phobia-cli](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/bundle-phobia-cli) [velibe](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/velibe)), some good old emacs plugins ([cask-package-toolset.el](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/cask-package-toolset.el) like [omni-control.el](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/omni-control.el) [omni-quotes.el](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/omni-quotes.el) or [omni-kill.el](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/omni-kill.el)).
I also sat up a lot of CI ages ago most were moved to my archives [GitHub Adriean Khisbe Archives](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe?tab=repositories)
