> :man_technologist:  In a nut(zsh)shell, some Software Engineer, who develops, deploys and open sources around with variable amounts of javascript, python, bash & irony 😉

Hello there :wave:
====================

Hey, I'm ***Adrien***, a french versatile software engineer living in Paris. :slightly_smiling_face:

Programmatically speaking, I craft code but also do some data, devops, tooling, doc&diagrams plus some open source. My main languages are javascript, python, and some shell, zsh flavor, and consider that git *c'est la vie* :light_blue_heart:

<!-- ! TODO add personality/leasures line 🚨 -->

<!-- TODO add contact here, maybe hidden formula from there -->

<!-- TODO: add nice separator, maybe as image. add some custom emoji/gif (diabolo,hello there, roll safe, coyote wink) -->

Aside for being some kind of expert in procrastination and heavy emoji user, I have some personal project like [diractions](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/diractions) or [zsh-quiet-accept-line](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/zsh-quiet-accept-line) and did some significative contributions to tools I use: :toolbox:
